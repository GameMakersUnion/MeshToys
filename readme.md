# MeshToys
The goal of this project is to provide easy-to-use tool to assist with development of [mesh](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Mesh.html)-related projects, by exposing [vertices, edges, and faces](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/vertices-faces-edges.html) with a progression of colors. Two implementations are under way: one is a script that you simply attach to an object, another is simply invoked via code that accepts a Mesh array being passed in.  
The images illustrate the stages of development.
